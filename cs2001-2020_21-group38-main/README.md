Our web application helps towards the sustainable development goal of 'Sustainable Consumption and Production'.

We are passionate about promoting sustainable lifestyles whilst positively impacting poverty and transitioning to low-carbon and green economies

We want to help create a world which encourages low-carbon and green economies to promote sustainable lifestyles such that future generations benefit from our actions today. This app aims to create awareness of eradicating poverty by educating others on sustainable charitable initiatives.
