			<p;>Our goal is to contribute to the UN and help them tackle
				sustainable development goals. Our product is designed to educate
				everyone so they have a better understanding of the SDGs and we hope
				through that understanding everyone can help towards the goal. Our
				website also helps those who use food banks to find food stock and
				helps food banks find it’s clients as well as help reduce food waste
				for restaurants. We also have a page for water to help tackle the
				water crisis in the world. There are many more things available here
				from reducing carbon foot prints to discussion forums to even
				quizzes.</p>

				<b> What are the Sustainable Development Goals? </b>
			</h4>
			<p;>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the
				Global Goals, were adopted by all United Nations Member States in
				2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the
				planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by
				2030. The 17 SDGs are integrated—that is, they recognize that action
				in one area will affect outcomes in others, and that development
				must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.
				Through the pledge to Leave No One Behind, countries have committed
				to fast-track progress for those furthest behind first. That is why
				the SDGs are designed to bring the world to several life-changing
				‘zeros’, including zero poverty, hunger, AIDS and discrimination
				against women and girls. Everyone is needed to reach these ambitious
				targets. The creativity, knowhow, technology and financial resources
				from all of society is necessary to achieve the SDGs in every
				context.</p>
			<p;>Here is a video briefly explaining all 17 goals:</p>

			</p>
			<p;>The SDGs replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
				which started a global effort in 2000 to tackle the indignity of
				poverty. The MDGs established measurable, universally-agreed
				objectives for tackling extreme poverty and hunger, preventing
				deadly diseases, and expanding primary education to all children,
				among other development priorities.</p>
			<h5 style="margin-bottom: 4px; font-family: sans-serif;">
				<b> Key MDG achievements </b>
			</h5>
			<p>
				- More than 1 billion people have been lifted out of extreme poverty
				(since 1990) <br> - Child mortality dropped by more than half
				(since 1990)<br> - The number of out of school children has
				dropped by more than half (since 1990)<br> - HIV/AIDS
				infections fell by almost 40 percent (since 2000)
